        <h2 id="bethanchor">Beth King</h2>
        <p>ARMY ● STAFF SERGEANT ● MISSOURI</p>
        <p>In 2011, while Beth King was deployed to Afghanistan, her helicopter took a direct hit from a rocket-propelled grenade. With the inside of the aircraft on fire, Beth fell out of the hatch and dangled in the air from her backstrap until the pilots could make a hard landing. Because she had no visible wounds, she was sent back out on another flight just four days later. But it wasn’t long before she realized she was seriously injured.</p>
        <p>“I felt devastated and asked for help,” says Beth. “But the military is mission-driven, so if you looked like you could work, you worked.”</p>
        <p>Beth’s injuries turned out to be very severe. Hanging from her backstrap had caused trauma to her spine, and the explosion and shock wave left her with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). “I had 24/7 pain in my head,” says Beth. “I was foggy and couldn’t understand things. After a few months, I started dropping things, experiencing balance issues, and having a hard time walking. After 18 months, I finally started getting treatment.”</p>
        <p>Soon after her injury, Beth also began to experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She fell into depression and struggled to leave her house. “Everything seemed to be a trigger,” says Beth. But after nearly four years of not being physically active, she decided in 2016 that it was up to her to make the most of her new situation, so she took up cycling to build her strength.</p>
        <p>Two years later, she participated in her first Wounded Warrior Project® Soldier Ride®, which changed her world. “It was the first time I had done anything independently since my injury,” says Beth. “I realized I don’t have to lose an activity just because I don’t do it the same as everyone else.</p>
        <p>“Wounded Warrior Project helped me find a support network of people who inspire me to keep going and who help me realize I can still do anything I put my mind to.”</p>
        <p>Besides making new friends, she learned about other adaptive sports opportunities that have helped her thrive. “I’m not just playing sports,” says Beth, “I am bettering myself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Wounded Warrior Project gave me a community of people who understand the struggle is real. And being a part of something bigger than myself played a huge part in my mental health recovery.”</p>
        <p>Beth’s next mission: to educate people about the importance of seeking treatment as soon as an injury occurs, especially when their injuries aren’t visible. “I believe that waiting amplified the effects of my injury,” says Beth.</p>
        <p>“TBIs can progress and get worse while not treated. I also want to educate people about the positive effects of adaptive sports. If I had known about that sooner, maybe I would not have gotten so dark, withdrawn, and given up on life. Now I truly believe there is nothing I set my mind to that I will not be able to figure out how to do.”</p>

        <img width= "30%" src="../images/Aaron-Cornelius.jpg">
        <h2 id="aaronanchor">Aaron Cornelius</h2>
        <p>ARMY ● SERGEANT FIRST CLASS ● FLORIDA</p>
        <p>Aaron Cornelius saw a lot of combat while leading U.S. Army soldiers through three deployments in Iraq. But it wasn’t until the last deployment that, as Aaron says, “all hell broke loose.” It was March of 2008 when his unit suffered multiple casualties at the scene of an improvised explosive device (IED) attack. When Aaron arrived, he tried to open the hatch to save the soldiers inside the burning Humvee — but it became immediately apparent they were gone. Little did he know that moment’s heartbreaking death and destruction was one of the last things he would ever see. Just days later, the vehicle he was riding in was blown up, and the shrapnel tore a tennis ball-sized hole in his skull, leaving him completely blind.</p>
        <p>Not only did Aaron’s medical retirement mean he had to make the difficult transition to civilian life with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but he also had to transition to a life without sight.</p>
        <p>The first tears came when he realized he would never be able to see his daughter’s face again. “I started to notice the darkness a lot,” says Aaron. “I couldn’t do anything at that point. I couldn’t walk. I felt helpless. I felt like the military just kicked me to the curb and that I was not good anymore — worthless.”</p>
        <p>Aaron’s first contact with Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP) occurred while he was still in the hospital. “At the hospital, you get all these visitors,” says Aaron. “Then this one guy came in, and he kept coming back, checking on me almost every day. He brought me a backpack and all kinds of information and walked me through the madness of transition and all the paperwork.”</p>
        <p>“Thanks to Wounded Warrior Project, I still have a purpose. They helped me be myself again, and now I’m able to help my fellow warriors.”</p>
        <p>“That WWP guy stuck with me,” recalls Aaron. “Even after I left the hospital, he would call and see how I was doing. WWP was constant and made me feel like I was being taken care of. All of the things we had to do or figure out, we’d say, ‘Who’s going to help us with that?’ WWP stepped right in and took the reins. That was a beautiful thing.”</p>
        <p>Aaron says a significant turning point in his recovery came when he met other injured soldiers at a WWP event. “I was able to be myself outside of the house,” says Aaron. “I realized I could be a normal guy, a normal person, and there were people like me I could talk to.”</p>
        <p>Since then, Aaron has participated in many WWP events to connect with his fellow warriors. He cherishes any opportunity to speak with and motivate other veterans — especially those who have struggled to cope with life after the military.</p>
        <p>“Too many are killing themselves because they can’t cope,” says Aaron. “I want to find these guys and say, ‘Call me. I don’t care if you’re hurt or whatever. Call me. If I have to, I'll come out there with my dog and get you.’ I want to show these brothers that we’re still together. We can still be right there to back each other up.”</p>


        <img width= "30%" src="../images/Chris-Gordon.jpg">
        <h2 id="chrisanchor">Chris Gordon</h2>
        <p>ARMY ● STAFF SERGEANT ● FLORIDA</p>
        <p>Chris Gordon joined the U.S. Army in 1997. His first duty station was Hohenfels, Germany — where he was on September 11, 2001. Chris grew up in New York, so the events of that day hit close to home.</p>
        <p>“My family still all lived in New York,” says Chris. “I called back home and tried to find out what was going on. My mom was working in the city at the time. A cousin of mine actually worked at the World Trade Center — but she was late that morning. Thankfully, everybody was ok.”</p>
        <p>By the time the war began, Chris was assigned to a Stryker armored vehicle unit as an infantry supply sergeant. In 2005, Chris’ unit was on patrol in Tal-Afar, Iraq, in their Stryker vehicles, finishing what seemed like a routine search. As his vehicle rolled up to get in line around a mosque, it set off an explosion.</p>
        <p>The blast from the improvised explosive device launched Chris and another soldier out of the Stryker’s back hatch. “Thank God we had the hatches open,” says Chris. “If they had been closed, I wouldn’t be here today.”</p>
        <p>It wasn’t until Chris woke up at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, DC, that he realized he had lost his right leg and had a permanent titanium rod in his left leg.</p>
        <p>“Rehab was intense,” says Chris. “At first, you’re in a wheelchair, and eventually, you start gaining back your strength. You have to learn how to get up, use a prosthetic, and walk again.”</p>
        <p>“Wounded Warrior Project played an integral role in improving my quality of life.”</p>
        <p>While at Walter Reed, Chris was introduced to Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP) and received a backpack full of comfort items. “It showed some appreciation during the toughest time of my life,” says Chris. “People out there still cared what happened, even though they didn’t know me.”</p>
        <p>He continued his newfound relationship with WWP through an adaptive sports weekend in San Diego and a ski trip to Colorado. “I got to go to places I had never gone before,” says Chris. And I learned I was still capable of participating in a lot of different activities.”</p>
        <p>As a direct result of Chris’ involvement with WWP, he now golfs, rides horses, and spends time with his fellow warriors. He has also had the opportunity to return to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, one of the hospitals where he was treated for his injuries, to thank the staff for saving his life.</p>
        <p>“WWP has been a big part of my life since I was injured,” says Chris. “They have provided me with countless unforgettable experiences so I can keep moving in a positive direction, both mentally and physically.”</p>

        <img width= "30%" src="../images/Melissa-McMahon.jpg">
        <h2>Melissa McMahon</h2>
        <p>AIR FORCE ● CAPTAIN ● NEVADA</p>
        <p>During her years as a nurse in the Air Force, Melissa McMahon saw more than her fair share of pain, suffering, and death. In 2015 and 2016, she was in Afghanistan, caring for severely injured Americans, coalition forces, local civilians, and even some insurgents — all while her hospital was fired upon by enemy rockets. When she was medically discharged in 2018, Melissa returned home with more than physical injuries to her back and hip — she was also battling symptoms of severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
        <p>For a long time, she tried to fight through the physical pain and deny the effects of PTSD, but as a nurse, it caught up with her. “It took a lot out of me,” says Melissa. “It broke my heart, but I finally had to tell my therapist and supervisor that I couldn’t take care of patients safely anymore.”</p>
        <p>Melissa felt useless and was mad at herself. “You start that process where you beat yourself up and start playing the blame or shame game,” Melissa says. Thankfully, when she realized she was having more bad days than good ones, she decided to get help. Her turning point came when she joined a Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP) Physical Health & Wellness program. “They helped me fix my metabolism because I was not eating enough,” says Melissa. “But the biggest thing was meeting more warriors. They had also gone through tough situations, and when I got to know them, I realized they could understand what I’d been through. I wasn’t alone.”</p>
        <p>“There is more strength and bravery in asking for help than trying to do things by yourself. Wounded Warrior Project can be that extra hand to guide you and show you you’re not alone.”</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as she started to build new relationships with warriors, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced society to reimagine social connection. WWP shifted its focus to virtual programs to serve warriors and their families safely — and, luckily, Melissa thrived in a virtual environment. “When COVID hit, I still wasn’t fully coming out of my shell,” says Melissa. “With virtual events, I was in the safety of my own home. I could build that trust relationship while still in a safe space.”</p>
        <p>“I really liked the WWP Talk program,” says Melissa. “It was not like a therapy session. I could just talk about what was going on — just daily things. It provided a safe person to talk to.” She has also done a Project Odyssey®, participates in a WWP Peer Support group, and is a Warrior Leader.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason she stays so active is to fulfill her newfound purpose — encouraging other warriors to get involved and teaching them life is better when they go through it together. “I want other warriors to know they are not alone — there is a great support network,” Melissa says. “They can feel that camaraderie again, or that fun. There were times in my life I did not know if I would ever get to experience joy again. Real joy! But thanks to Wounded Warrior Project, I have laughed until I cried with other warriors. To be able to share that with somebody else, or to help them get through whatever is going on in their life — that’s important.”</p>



        <img width= "30%" src="../images/Tim-Aponte.jpg">
        <h2>Tim Aponte</h2>
        <p>ARMY ● SERGEANT ● MASSACHUSETTS</p>
        <p>For nearly 10 years, Tim Aponte loved serving in the U.S. Army. “You had total strangers banding together, willing to watch each other’s backs,” says Tim. “It was something I would never trade for anything else.” Then, just 53 days before he was scheduled to return home, a rocket-propelled grenade exploded near him, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), internal shrapnel injuries, and a broken back.</p>
        <p>Suddenly ripped away from his unit against his will, Tim struggled as much with the loss of camaraderie as he did with the lengthy and painful recovery from his physical injuries. Instead of feeling at home, he felt alone. In denial of having post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), his bouts of anger and depression got so bad that he fell into a dangerous downward spiral. He ended up homeless, living in a veteran’s shelter, and considering taking his own life.</p>
        <p>That’s when Tim decided to make a change. He immersed himself in college and sought help through the VA. After spending four years trying to find a vision for his future, however, a Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP) event finally gave him a glimpse of what was possible.</p>
        <p>“Even though I didn’t know anybody,” says Tim, “I found it cool because I ended up in a duck boat full of other veterans. I thrive most when I’m part of a community. I knew I wanted that.”</p>
        <p>“My life has been enriched by Wounded Warrior Project. Any time I’ve ever needed anything, the Wounded Warrior Project team has always been there.”</p>
        <p>At another event, he learned about WWP’s Warrior Care Network® and soon began receiving intensive outpatient treatment for his PTSD and TBI. “I’m not going to lie to you,” says Tim. “It was life changing.” For him, one of the most uncomfortable parts of the program — having to do things that took him out of his comfort zone — ended up being one of the most rewarding.</p>
        <p>He also believes aftercare is a big part of what separates Warrior Care Network. “They don’t just help you find a therapist in your own community,” says Tim. “They help you find the right therapist. It’s an awesome program.”</p>
        <p>Since participating in Warrior Care Network, Tim’s journey has included Soldier Ride®, Project Odyssey®, and many events in his local community. Now, his mission is to find ways to use what he has learned and experienced to help other veterans on their journeys to recovery.</p>
        <p>Today, Tim is a WWP Peer Support Group leader for multiple groups where he shares his story and encourages others to do the same. “It’s given me purpose, direction, and motivation,” says Tim. “I didn’t have somebody to guide me or give me good advice — somebody to say, ‘Hey, I got you.’ I want to be that person for others, so they know they’re not alone.”</p>
