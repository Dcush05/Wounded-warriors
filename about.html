        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="box">
        <p>Established in 2003, the Wounded Warrior Project has had for a mission to honor and empower wounded veterans and service members who served on or after 9/11. Across our variety of programs, we have helped veterans receive the resources and care they need. Today, the Wounded Warrior Project has expanded its services to mental health support, career counseling, long-term rehabilitative care and advocacy.</p>
        <p>Wounded Warriors strives to extend its support to wounded veterans in any capacity, whether it be financial or moral. With that said, Wounded Warriors Notes was created to collect and send your kind words to the heroes who served this country. We recognize the value of words and aim to extend our gratitude to those who deserve it.</p>
